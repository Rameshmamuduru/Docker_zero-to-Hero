Absolutely! 💪 I can give you a **realistic “PROD-ready Docker labs/assignments roadmap”** that will take you from beginner to production-level understanding of Docker and containerization.

These labs are **hands-on**, progressively complex, and mimic **real-time production scenarios**.

---

# 🐳 Docker & Container Labs / Assignments

---

## **Level 1: Basic Docker Skills**

### Lab 1: Hello Docker

**Objective:** Run your first container

* Pull `nginx` image and run it
* Map container port 80 to host port 8080
* Access via browser
* Stop and remove container

**Commands to practice:** `docker pull`, `docker run`, `docker ps`, `docker stop`, `docker rm`

---

### Lab 2: Basic Dockerfile

**Objective:** Build your own image

* Create `Dockerfile` for a simple Python app
* Expose port 5000
* Use `ENV` to configure message
* Build and run

**Learning:** `FROM`, `COPY`, `WORKDIR`, `ENV`, `EXPOSE`, `CMD`

---

### Lab 3: Understanding Volumes

**Objective:** Persistent storage

* Run a container with a volume
* Write a file inside `/data` in container
* Stop and start container, verify file persists
* Compare with container **without volume**

**Learning:** `-v`, anonymous volumes, named volumes

---

## **Level 2: Intermediate / PROD Concepts**

### Lab 4: Multi-stage Dockerfile

**Objective:** Reduce image size

* Use a multi-stage build for a Java or NodeJS app
* Build in `builder` stage
* Copy artifact to final lightweight image
* Run container and verify

**Learning:** Multi-stage builds, image optimization

---

### Lab 5: Non-root User & Security

**Objective:** Run container as non-root user

* Add system user in Dockerfile
* Switch using `USER`
* Mount volume and fix permissions
* Run container

**Learning:** Security best practices in PROD

---

### Lab 6: ENV Variables & Config

**Objective:** Environment-based configuration

* Use `ENV` and `ARG` in Dockerfile
* Use `docker run -e` to override ENV variables
* Run same image in dev/test/prod with different configs

**Learning:** Separation of code and config

---

### Lab 7: Healthcheck

**Objective:** Auto-healing readiness

* Add `HEALTHCHECK` instruction
* Verify `docker ps` shows health status
* Simulate app failure and observe

**Learning:** HEALTHCHECK, monitoring readiness

---

## **Level 3: Advanced / Real-Time PROD Scenarios**

### Lab 8: Docker + Shared Storage

**Objective:** Shared app data with volumes

* Mount a volume for logs/uploads
* Run 2 containers of same image
* Verify shared access
* (Optional) Map volume to host directory or EFS

**Learning:** Volumes, shared data, multi-container apps

---

### Lab 9: Multi-container App (Docker Compose)

**Objective:** Build a small PROD-like stack

* Java or Python app + MySQL + Redis
* Use Docker Compose
* Link containers with networks
* Use volumes for MySQL persistence
* Scale app container `docker-compose up --scale app=3`

**Learning:** Networking, scaling, persistent storage

---

### Lab 10: Logging & Monitoring

**Objective:** Production readiness

* Redirect app logs to mounted volume
* Use `docker logs` and `tail` for inspection
* (Optional) Forward logs to host or ELK stack

**Learning:** Centralized logging, monitoring basics

---

### Lab 11: Image Optimization & Security

**Objective:** Make your image production-ready

* Remove unnecessary packages
* Use smaller base images (Alpine)
* Scan image for vulnerabilities (`docker scan`)

**Learning:** Lightweight images, security best practices

---

### Lab 12: CI/CD Pipeline Integration (Optional)

**Objective:** Deploy app via Jenkins or GitHub Actions

* Build Docker image in pipeline
* Push to private registry
* Run container on test server automatically
* Deploy multiple environments (dev/stage/prod)

**Learning:** Docker in CI/CD, multi-env deployment

---

## ✅ Suggested Roadmap Order

1. Labs 1–3 → Understand Docker basics
2. Labs 4–7 → Production-ready image creation
3. Labs 8–12 → Multi-container and PROD scenarios

If you want, I can **write a ready-to-run PDF lab guide** with **commands, expected outputs, and tips** — so you can follow it like a real PROD hands-on course.

Do you want me to make that PDF?
